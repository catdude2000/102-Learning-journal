# What I learned in my first class

Today I learned how to make a repository on Github.
  Github is a website that allows people to write and share code with one another.  It is open-source, that means it's free to use and people can build off of each others ideas.  A repository is a section of Github that houses multiple files, such as README or License files, in one place, where they can be edited and put together to make a website.
  Creating and editing files is fairly simple.  All you do is click on your repository, click "add file", click "create file" and a page to create a new file will pop up.  On this page you will name your file, give it some content using text and markdowns, put a description of the file down, and then click commit file.  After that, your new file will show up on the same list as any existing files you may have.
    Markdown is a language used to edit the format of text in text editor programs.  (like the ones used in Github)  Different symbols, such as asterisks and underlines, can be used to underline, italicise, or bolden text.  Markdowns can also be used to show links to different URL's that your repository may contain.

I was able to add the above link using symbols like ],(, and *
When typing it out to add to a file it would look something like this on a new line. "-[texttoappear] (filename.md)"  Although, there would be no space in the middle.  That was added to be able to show the text as it would appear in editing.
  All in all I feel this has been a very good start to the class, and am excited to continue.
