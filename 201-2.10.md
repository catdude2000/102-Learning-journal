JS  
Ch 10: Error Handling and Debugging  
Understanding execution contexts (which have two stages) and stacks, makes it more likely to find the error in your code  
Debugging is the process of finding errors, it involves a process of deduction  
console helps narrow down error search  
JS has 7 different types of errors, each creates its own error objet, which can tell you line number and description of error  
if you know you may get an error, you can use the "try, catch, finally" statements to give your users helpful feedback
