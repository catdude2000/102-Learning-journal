React Docs - Forms

1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?  
An input form element whose value is controlled by React
after combining two things (not sure what) the react component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input.

2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why?  
second one because then you can now pass the value to other UI elements too, or reset it from other event handlers.  

3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?  
add a name attribute to each element and let the handler function choose what to do based on the value of event.target.name.  

Ternary operator  

1. Why would we use a ternary operator?  
to Shorten your if statements into one line of code  

2. Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:  

if(x===y){  
  console.log(true);  
} else {  
  console.log(false);  
}  
//////////////////////////////////  

console.log = x===y ? 'Yes' : 'No';
