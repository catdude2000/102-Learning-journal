1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?  
An input form element whose value is controlled by React  

2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why?  
update the state as soon as they enter their responses, to have greater control using state, you can pass the value to other UI elements, or reset it from other event handlers.  

3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?  
Using a name attribute and onChange.  


The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained  
<https://codeburst.io/javascript-the-conditional-ternary-operator-explained-cac7218beeff>  

Why would we use a ternary operator?  
To shorten an if statement into one line of code.  

Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:  

if(x===y){  
  console.log(true);  
} else {  
  console.log(false);  
}  
x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)
