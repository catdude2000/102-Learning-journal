# Notes for Reading three

HTML  
Ch 3: Lists  
"definition" lists are made up of terms and their definitions  
dt=definition term,  dd=definition  
list in another list is a "nested list"  

Ch 13: Boxes  
most popular ways to specify size of box is to use pixels, %s, or ems  
use min and max widths for expanding and shrinking stuff, same with height  
overflow property tells browser what to do if content in a box is larger than the box itself  
  -"hidden" hides it, "scroll" allows you to scroll  
shorthand border property allows you to specify width, style and color of a border in one property (in that order)  
display property allows you to turn inline elements to block and vice versa  
visibility property allows you to hide boxes from users but leaves a space where the element would have been.  
box-shadow is like text-shadow  
css3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders  

JS  
ch 2 70-73:Basic JS Instructions  
Arraysupdate arrays using arrayName[#] = 'newArrayItem';  

Ch 4 162-182: Decisions and Loops  
"switch statement" starts with a variable called switch value  
  -each "case" indicates a possible value for this variable and the code to run if it matches  
unlike if...else statements, switch statements have a default option to run, and will stop checking cases when a match is found  
JS tries to make sense of stuff rather than reporting an error.  
every value in js can be treated as true or false  
a "unary operator" returns a result with just one operand.  
logical operators short circuit as soon as they have a result, and return the value that stopped it.  
"do while" loops are the same as while except it will always run whats in the curly brackets{}  
conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next  
===, !==, ==, !=, <,>,<=,>= are comparison operators  
logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators
