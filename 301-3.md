React Docs - lists and keys

1. What does .map() return?  
an array  

2. If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in   React?  
using map()  and putting the results in list items then in a ul

3. Each list item needs a unique ____.  
key  

4. What is the purpose of a key?  
A “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements.  
Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.  


The Spread Operator

1. What is the spread operator?  
a useful and quick syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a function’s arguments.

2. List 4 things that the spread operator can do.
The spread syntax “spreads” the array into separate arguments.  
copying an array
concatenating or combining arrays
using Math functions  

3. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.  
const myArray = [., ., .,]  
const yourArray = [., ., .,]  
const ourArray = [...myArray,...yourArray]  
console.log(...ourArray) ., ., ., ., ., .,

4. Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.  
const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']  
const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]  
console.log(fewMoreFruit) //  Array(5) [ "🍉", "🍍", "🍏", "🍊", "🍌" ]  

5. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.  
const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}  
const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}  
const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}  
console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }  
const objectFour = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: () => {console.log("😂".repeat(5))}}  
objectFour.laugh() // 😂😂😂😂😂  


How to Pass Functions Between Components  

1. In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?  
creating a function

2. In your own words, what does the increment function do?  
loops through the array to find names starting with p and increment them, modifying the array and using map to create a new array.  

3. How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?  
by referencing it in the person object, like increment=this.increment  


4. How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?  
calling it, this.props.increment(this.props.name)
