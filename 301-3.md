React Docs - lists and keys  

Using lists and keys with map() saves us time in writing lists and allows us to access multiple list elements at once.  

What does .map() return?  
A new array  

If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?  
Label a new Array that maps through the array of elements putting each element into an list tag/component (ls).  Then you can put the newly mapped array into another list tag/component (ul)  

Each list item needs a unique ____.  
key  

What is the purpose of a key?  
Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.  gives elements a stable identity.  


The Spread Operator 

The spread operator allows us to add, combine, or spread out arrays easily. 

What is the spread operator?  
a useful and quick syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a function’s arguments.  uses an ellipsis of three dots (…) to expand an iterable object into the list of arguments.

List 4 things that the spread operator can do.  
copying or concatenating/combining arrays, adds items to a list, adds state in react, combines objects  
 
Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.  
const hello = {hello: "😋😛😜🤪😝"}  
const world = {world: "🙂🙃😉😊😇🥰😍🤩!"}  
const helloWorld = {...hello,...world}

Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.  
const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']

Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.  
const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}  
const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}

How to Pass Functions Between Components  

Important for passing functions as props.

In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?  
creates a function  

In your own words, what does the increment function do?  
Goes through an array to find specific elements and increment them, changing the array to create a new array with map.  

How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?  
By referencing it in the object, like this.increment  

How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?  
By calling it this.props.increment(this.props.name)
