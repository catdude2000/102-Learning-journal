Article CSS Layout  
The display property does two things. The first thing it does is determine if the box it is applied to acts as inline or block.  
You can't set an explicit width and height on inline elements.  
Unless changed by other CSS code, a block element will expand to the size of the inline dimension, therefore spanning the full width in a horizontal writing mode.  
There are two main layout mechanisms that create layout rules for multiple elements, flexbox and grid.  
Flexbox is a layout mechanism for one-dimensional layouts. Layout across a single axis, either horizontally or vertically.  
lexbox also converts the child elements to be flex items, which means you can write rules on how they behave inside a flex container.  
Grid is similar in a lot of ways to flexbox, but it is designed to control multi-axis layouts instead of single-axis layouts  
Using inline-block gives you a box that has some of the characteristics of a block-level element, but still flows inline with the text.  
relative, absolute, fixed and sticky are position property options, with the default value being static  

HTML  
Ch 15: Layout  
CSS treats every html element as if it’s in it’s own box  
CSS has “positioning schemes” to control layout of page, using “position” property  
there is “normal flow” (position:static), “relative positioning” (position:relative), “absolute positioning” (position:absolute), “fixed positioning” (position:fixed), and “floating elements”  
z-index allows you to specify whats on top if elements overlap  
use float to place elements side-by-side  
“clear” property allows to say no element within the same containing element should toush left or right hand sides of a box  
ex: .clear(  
clear: left;) (or right, both, none)  
you can use .column containing width float and margin to make multi-column layouts
page size is usually 960-1000 pixels wide  
fixed width layouts (usually sized in pixels) don’t change sizes, liquid layouts (sized in percentages) do  
body element rule is to set width at 90%  
many use grid structures to help position items on a page, helps create professional and flexible designs.  
“CSS frameworks” can be used to save time, use @import on CSS page
what site is about is usuaully indicated in top 600 pixels.
