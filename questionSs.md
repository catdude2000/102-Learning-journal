This is my bus-mall website.  It shows the user three images of products and generates three randomized images from a list every time the user clicks on an image.  After choosing (clicking on) 25 images, the user can see the number of times they've clicked on an image and how many times each image was shown by clicking the "view results" button.  The number of clicks per image can also be seen in the form of a bar chart, using the "view chart" button.  Using local storage, you can refresh the page and bring up the previously shown results by clicking "see previous results"  I chose white as the background color so that the images would blend in better.  I customized the colors representing the images for the bar chart.



final project needs 3 pages, one of which is about us page.  
think about js logic, content of flash cards, way they're presented.


	Flash cards website.  Simple and direct.  Pick a category.  Categories would be from canvas topics.  CSS, JS, git, html, career, agile, problem domain.
Questions themselves could be original or could be quiz questions.
Could add related facts attached to answer sides of cards.
	Could have an array of questions in image form and an input box underneath.  Images (questions) would be presented in random order.  When you submit the answer the image will flip and you'll see the answer side of the card.
	The answer images could be stored in a seperate array and displayed only directly after it's matching question.  After each question is asked the image will be put into a new array so as not to be asked again.
	There will be a score kept and at the end (stretch goal) maybe it could tell you which concepts the user seemingly needs to work on, in text or graph form. Or maybe cards answered wrong could be put into an array to be asked again after the rest of the questions have been gone through.
Could add CSS animation on answer submition to make it look cool and more interactive.
Additional page needed could be for results/resources/tips.
