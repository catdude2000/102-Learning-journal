This is my bus-mall website.  It shows the user three images of products and generates three randomized images from a list every time the user clicks on an image.  After choosing (clicking on) 25 images, the user can see the number of times they've clicked on an image and how many times each image was shown by clicking the "view results" button.  The number of clicks per image can also be seen in the form of a bar chart, using the "view chart" button.  Using local storage, you can refresh the page and bring up the previously shown results by clicking "see previous results"  I chose white as the background color so that the images would blend in better.  I customized the colors representing the images for the bar chart.
