# Readings: Express, NPM, TDD, CI/CD

## These system tools are the basis of building software/servers

Reading  

## [An introduction to NodeJS and Express](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction)

Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.  
Middleware is what connects websites to the places they get their information from.  

Express the most popular __ __ ____.  
Node web framework  

Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?  
You can insert almost any compatible middleware you like into the request handling chain, in almost any order.  You can use any directory structure and structure the app in one file or many.  

What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?  
A module is a section of code that handles a specific purpose.  Modularization is useful because it makes code easier to read and easier to fix.  

## [What is NPM?](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm)

What version of npm are you running on your machine?  
9.6.4  

What command would you type to install a library/
package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?  
npm i jshint  

## [What is TDD?](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/)
(test driven development)  

Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.  
Tests allow you to see if your app is working as your making it.  

What are three expected benefits of testing  
- reductions in defect rates
- reduction in effort in project's final phases
- improved design qualities and technical qualities

Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.  
Individual  
- writing too many tests at once
- writing overly trivial tests or tests for trivial code

Team  
- poor maintanence of the test suite, often leading to long runtime
- abandoned test suites (seldom or never run)

## [CI/CD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSv_m3KhUO8)

What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?  
1. increases confidence in commits
2. Reduces risk
3. Faster results/feedback

What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?  
Delivery is for when code changes are being prepared to be released, deployment is for continously releasing code into the product.  

Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background.  
Github shows you test results and automatically passes on the code when tests pass.

Reflection  
What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class [README?](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-02/)  
I hope to learn how to write useful tests, and to discover uses for testing I've yet to find out about.  

## Things I want to know more about  
 
 How to know which kind of tests to write.
