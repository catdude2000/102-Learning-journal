# Prep: The Growth Mindset  

## Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice  
I did use this technique as a musician in highschool.  Practicing the difficult parts of a process does help more than practicing the easy parts.  

"Deliberate practice can be summarized as:  
Activities designed, typically by a teacher, for the sole purpose of effectively improving specific aspects of an individualâ€™s performance."  
Key ideas behind it:  
1. pushes you outside comfort zone  
2. repeated often  
3. continuously available feedback on results  
4. highly mentally demanding  
5. difficult  
6. requires good goals

Rosalind is another example designed to help you learn a technical specialty (bioinformatics) by applying your existing skills to real world problems.

"...snob is (someone who takes a small part of you to determine who you are as a whole)"
