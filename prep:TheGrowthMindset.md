# Prep: The Growth Mindset  

## Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice  
I did use this technique as a musician in highschool.  Practicing the difficult parts of a process does help more than practicing the easy parts.  

"Deliberate practice can be summarized as:  
Activities designed, typically by a teacher, for the sole purpose of effectively improving specific aspects of an individualâ€™s performance."  
Key ideas behind it:  
1. pushes you outside comfort zone  
2. repeated often  
3. continuously available feedback on results  
4. highly mentally demanding  
5. difficult  
6. requires good goals
