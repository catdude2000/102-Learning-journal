# Reading Notes 5

HTML  
Ch 5: Images  
" Align" attribute was used before HTML5, now CSS is the norm  
  -align uses left, right, top, middle, and bottom to align with text  
use css float to wrap text around an image  
images should be in correct format, size, and measured in pixels  
jpeg should be used for images with many different colors  
use gif or png for images with few colors or mainly one color  
vector images are resolution-independent  
partially transparent images need to be in gifs (straight edges and 100% transparent) or png (rounded, semi-transparent/semi-opaque)  
transparent pngs are often not supported in older browsers  
HTML5 introduced < figure> element to contain images with their caption  
< figcaption> lets you add a caption to an image  
photos should be saved as jpeg  

Ch 11: Color  
CSS3 introduces "opacity" property  
rgba adds "alpha" for opacity  
some browsers won't recognize rgba,  
if two rules apply to the same element the latter will take priority  
CSS3 introduces HLS (Hue, Saturation, lightness) color selector  
hsla is for adding transperancy  

ch 12: Text  
serif is traditionally used on letters, sans-serif is for screens  
monospace means every letter is the same width  
font sizes can be in pixels, percentages, or EMS  
" @font-face" allows you to specify a path to a font that might not be on a users computer,  
" font-weight" can be used to bold text  
" font-style" can use normal, italic, and oblique  
" text-transform" is used for letter casing  
" text-decoration" can use values of none, underline, overline, line-through, and blink  
" line-height" sets the height of an entire line of text  
" letter-spacing" and "word-spacing" are self described  
" text-indent" allows you to indent the first line of text in an element  
you can apply values to ":first-letter" and "first-line"  
" :link" and " :visited" let you style links  
any element you can interact with can have ":focus"  
attribute selectors include  " existence" ([]), " equality" ([ =]), " space" ([ ~=]), " prefix" ([   ^=]), " substring" ([ *=]), and " suffix" ([ $=])  

image article  
compression is either lossless or lossy  
jpeg is lossy  
png is lossless, uses "deflate compression"  
gif is lossless, uses LZW compression algorithm
