# Engineering Readings

## These are all important practical parts of the develpoment process.

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?  
  No one who has spent the same amount of time fixing software also has the same level of empathy, self-awareness, and appreciation for the everyday user as me.  Using and fixing computers has been a hobby of mine my entire life, but I learn wherever I go.  Now I can put what I've learned in my years of customer service together with what I've always done for fun.  

2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?  
- Pay attention to how much time I spend on one problem, so as not to get frustrated and go in circles.  
- Look on the internet or to a classmate for a different way to frame the issue or different approach.  (Reassess)
- Look at each failure as a step toward success.(Super Mario Effect)
