REST

Who is Roy Fielding?  

He helped create the programming for servers to send data across the internet.  
His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.  

Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?  
Because they weren't designed to be used like that.  Our primary concern now is talking to servers and API that then talk to other computers.  

What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?  
HTTP/1.0. draft-fielding-http-spec-01. Versions: The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)  
is all about applying "verbs" to "nouns".  GETing (verb) things (nouns) from URLs.
