# Prep: The Growth Mindset  

## Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice  
I did use this technique as a musician in highschool.  Practicing the difficult parts of a process does help more than practicing the easy parts.  

"Deliberate practice can be summarized as:  
Activities designed, typically by a teacher, for the sole purpose of effectively improving specific aspects of an individualâ€™s performance."  
Key ideas behind it:  
1. pushes you outside comfort zone  
2. repeated often  
3. continuously available feedback on results  
4. highly mentally demanding  
5. difficult  
6. requires good goals  

The Matasano Crypto Challenges are excersises that meet these criteria for most intermediate and senior level devs.  

Rosalind is another example designed to help you learn a technical specialty (bioinformatics) by applying your existing skills to real world problems.  

## Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset  
### "The power of believing that you can improve"  

Some scientists say the growth mindset is reflected by higher brain activity.  
Pushing out of comfort zone to learn something new makes new connections in the brain.  
Growth mindset has been shown to help kids learn.  

## Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit  
### "Grit: The power of passion and perseverance"  

"Grit is living life like a marathon, not a sprint"  
"... growth mindset is a great idea for building grit"  

## Alain de Botton on Redefining Success  
### "A kinder, gentler philosophy of success"  

"...snob is (someone who takes a small part of you to determine who you are as a whole)"  
A measure of equality is needed for envy, modern society projects this equality.  
Meritocracy society makes failure seem worse, genuine meritocracy is impossible.  
Tragedy in art creates sympathy that real life does not.

I don't know if I'd agree that self-awareness(score=18) is a good measure of emotional intelligence, or at least not as much to have it's own category.  I would say self-management(15) is directly related and should be taken into account when considering self-awareness.  I'm generally socially aware(15), except when I want something from someone, then I can't usually be objective in the moment, although eventually reflecting later usually provides accurate insight.  Aside from expecting to much of people, relationship management(19) has always been fairly easy for me.

I consider myself pretty good at identifying and challenging biases.  I actually find it a road to peacefullness of the mind.  I hate not being able to understand the actions of others.  The answers that society throws at us, such as greed, stupidity, evil are not inherent more for one person to the next, generally speaking.  As a white male, I do find it challenging to openly discuss biases, as most societal biases relating to gender and race don't affect me negatively.  I fear that I may be more out of touch than I realize, or that I may be ignored or revered for seeming that way.
