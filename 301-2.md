# 301 Reading Two  

React lifecycle  

1. Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?  
Render  

2. What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?  
mounting, starting with "Constructor"  

3. Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates  
Constructor, render, componenentdidmount, React Updates, componentWillUnmount.  

4. What does componentDidMount do?  
It can load things using a network request or intialize the DOM.  Is a place to set up subscriptions.  setState() can be called here, but should be used sparingly to prevent rerendering  


State vs Props  

1. What types of things can you pass in the props?  
Counting components, title and subtitles to display, many others  

2. What is the big difference between props and state?  
Props are passed into a component, state is handled inside that component, and props are handled outside of the component, when you change states it will rerender your app, props need to be passed down to change them.  

3. When do we re-render our application?  
After user input  

4. What are some examples of things that we could store in state?  
values updated by the user, user input info in general?
