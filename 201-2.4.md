# Reading Notes 4

HTML
Ch 4: Links
Links are created using the < a> element
URL= Uniform Resource Locator
  -"absolute" links to new site, "relative" to page in same site
use "mailto:" to set up a link to open users email and start a new message
use "target" (target="_blank") to open link in new window (let users know first)
link to a part of the same page using id attribute in href
link to specific part of another page using id attribute at end of link

Ch 15: Layout
CSS treats every html element as if it's in it's own box
CSS has "positioning schemes" to control layout of page, using "position" property
there is "normal flow" (position:static), "relative positioning" (position:relative), "absolute positioning" (position:absolute), "fixed positioning" (position:fixed), and "floating elements"
z-index allows you to specify whats on top if elements overlap
use float to place elements side-by-side
"clear" property allows to say no element within the same containing element should toush left or right hand sides of a box
ex: .clear(
clear: left;)     (or right, both, none)
you can use .column containing width float and margin to make multi-column layouts
page size is usually 960-1000 pixels wide
fixed width layouts (usually sized in pixels) don't change sizes, liquid layouts (sized in percentages) do
body element rule is to set width at 90%
many use grid structures to help position items on a page
"CSS frameworks" can be used to save time, use @import on CSS page
what site is about is usuaully indicated in top 600 pixels


JS
Ch 3: Functions, Methods, Objects
If function is where expression is expected it's called "function expression"
  -usually using "anonymous function"
immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) is an iffy
where a variable can be used is called it's "scope" (local, function-level, global)
global variables use more memory
Pair Programming
  -helps you learn and raises efficiency
