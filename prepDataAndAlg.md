## Discussion Questions

What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?  
[Cheat-sheet]<https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/>  
Are we using fixed data or variable/changing data?

How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?  
"...ensure that progress is made toward the basis case or cases in every recursive call."

## Things I want to know more about  

I wish I understood the big O equation more.  
Also how did it become so widely used?
