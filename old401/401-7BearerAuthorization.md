## [Are JWTs Secure?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27301557/if-you-can-decode-jwt-how-are-they-secure)  

If I get a JWT and I can decode the payload, how can we call that secure?  
It still has to match the authorization.  

If sending a JWT, what must sender and receiver both know? Hint, itâ€™s appended in the signature.  
Authorization data. (username and password, like a key-value pair)  

Explain how concatenated content and secret can be sent and received securely to a non-technical recruiter.
