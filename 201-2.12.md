Chart.js  
Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables  
first thing to do is dl Chart.js. Copy Chart.min.js out of the unzipped folder and into the directory you’ll be working in. Then create a new html page and import the script  
To draw a line chart, we need to create a canvas element in our HTML  
next, we need to write a script that will retrieve the context of the canvas  
Inside the same script tags we need to create our data  
pie chart: First, we need the canvas element  
Next, we need to get the context and to instantiate the chart  
Next we need to create the data, supply a value and a color for each section  
immediately after the pieData we’ll add our options  
bar chart: add the canvas element  
retrieve the element and create the graph  
add in the bar chart’s data  
RGBA to specify our colors which allows us to add transparency

canvas tags
The < canvas> element differs from an < img> tag in that, like for < video>, < audio>, or < picture> elements, it is easy to define some fallback content, just insert the alternate content inside the < canvas> element.  
< canvas> element requires the closing tag (</ canvas>)  
If fallback content is not needed, a simple < canvas id="foo" ...></ canvas> is fully compatible with all browsers  
the < canvas> element has a method called getContext(), used to obtain the rendering context and its drawing functions  
The first line in the script retrieves the node in the DOM representing the < canvas> element by calling the document.getElementById() method  

drawing shapes  
canvas grid or "coordinate space"  
Normally 1 unit in the grid corresponds to 1 pixel on the canvas  
There are three functions that draw rectangles on the canvas:  
fillRect(x, y, width, height)  
Draws a filled rectangle.  
strokeRect(x, y, width, height)  
Draws a rectangular outline.  
clearRect(x, y, width, height)  
Clears the specified rectangular area, making it fully transparent.  

drawing paths  
First, you create the path.  
Then you use drawing commands to draw into the path.  
Once the path has been created, you can stroke or fill the path to render it.  
Here are the functions used to perform these steps:  
beginPath()  
Creates a new path.
Path methods  
Methods to set different paths for objects.  
closePath()  
Adds a straight line to the path, going to the start of the current sub-path.  
stroke()  
Draws the shape by stroking its outline.  
fill()  
Draws a solid shape by filling the path's content area.  
which doesn't actually draw anything but becomes part of the path list described above, is the moveTo() function  
For drawing straight lines, use the lineTo() method.  
To draw arcs or circles, we use the arc() or arcTo() methods  
Bézier curves, available in both cubic and quadratic varieties  
EX: quadraticCurveTo(cp1x, cp1y, x, y) bezierCurveTo(cp1x, cp1y, cp2x, cp2y, x, y)  
uadratic Bézier curve has a start and an end point (blue dots) and just one control point   (indicated by the red dot) while a cubic Bézier curve uses two control points  
The x and y parameters in both of these methods are the coordinates of the end point. cp1x and cp1y are the coordinates of the first control point, and cp2x and cp2y are the coordinates of the second control point.  
there's also the rect() method, which adds a rectangular path to a currently open path.  
Path2D()
The Path2D() constructor returns a newly instantiated Path2D object, optionally with another path as an argument (creates a copy), or optionally with a string consisting of SVG path data.  
all path methods are available on path2d objects  
Another powerful feature of the new canvas Path2D API is using SVG path data to initialize paths on your canvas.  

Colors  
fillStyle = color  
Sets the style used when filling shapes.  
strokeStyle = color  
Sets the style for shapes' outlines.  
 we can also draw semi-transparent (or translucent) shapes. This is done by either setting the globalAlpha property or by assigning a semi-transparent color to the stroke and/or fill style.  

There are several properties which allow us to style lines.  
lineWidth = value  
Sets the width of lines drawn in the future.  
lineCap = type  
Sets the appearance of the ends of lines.  
lineJoin = type  
Sets the appearance of the "corners" where lines meet.  
miterLimit = value  
Establishes a limit on the miter when two lines join at a sharp angle, to let you control how thick the junction becomes.  
getLineDash()  
Returns the current line dash pattern array containing an even number of non-negative numbers.  
setLineDash(segments)  
Sets the current line dash pattern.  
lineDashOffset = value  
Specifies where to start a dash array on a line.  
lineCap property determines how the end points of every line are drawn. There are three possible values for this property and those are: butt, round and square  
lineJoin property determines how two connecting segments (of lines, arcs or curves) with non-zero lengths in a shape are joined together  
round  
Rounds off the corners of a shape by filling an additional sector of disc centered at the common endpoint of connected segments. The radius for these rounded corners is equal to half the line width.  
bevel  
Fills an additional triangular area between the common endpoint of connected segments, and the separate outside rectangular corners of each segment.  
miter  
Connected segments are joined by extending their outside edges to connect at a single point, with the effect of filling an additional lozenge-shaped area. This setting is effected by the miterLimit property which is explained below.  
The setLineDash method and the lineDashOffset property specify the dash pattern for lines  
We create a CanvasGradient object by using one of the following methods. We can then assign this object to the fillStyle or strokeStyle properties.  
createLinearGradient(x1, y1, x2, y2)  
Creates a linear gradient object with a starting point of (x1, y1) and an end point of (x2, y2).  
createRadialGradient(x1, y1, r1, x2, y2, r2)  
Creates a radial gradient. The parameters represent two circles, one with its center at (x1, y1)   and a radius of r1, and the other with its center at (x2, y2) with a radius of r2.  
createConicGradient(angle, x, y)  
Creates a conic gradient object with a starting angle of angle in radians, at the position (x, y).  
createPattern(image, type)  
Creates and returns a new canvas pattern object. image is a CanvasImageSource (that is, an HTMLImageElement, another canvas, a < video> element, or the like. type is a string indicating how to use the image.  
When using fill (or clip and isPointInPath) you can optionally provide a fill rule algorithm by which to determine if a point is inside or outside a path and thus if it gets filled or not.  

drawing text  
The canvas rendering context provides two methods to render text:  
fillText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])  
Fills a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.  
strokeText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])  
Strokes a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.  
Styling  
font = value  
The current text style being used when drawing text. This string uses the same syntax as the CSS font property. The default font is 10px sans-serif.  
textAlign = value  
Text alignment setting. Possible values: start, end, left, right or center. The default value is start.  
textBaseline = value  
Baseline alignment setting. Possible values: top, hanging, middle, alphabetic, ideographic, bottom. The default value is alphabetic.  
direction = value  
Directionality. Possible values: ltr, rtl, inherit. The default value is inherit.  
measureText()  
Returns a TextMetrics object containing the width, in pixels, that the specified text will be when drawn in the current text style.
