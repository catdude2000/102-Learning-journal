### [Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-05/resources/big_oh.html) (Up through the section titled “Linear Complexity Growth”)

"Running Time (also known as **time** efficiency / complexity)  
The amount of time a function needs to complete."  
"Memory Space (also known as **space** efficiency / complexity)  
The amount of memory resources a function uses to store data and instructions."  
Big O describes worst case.  
4 key areas for analysis:  

1. Input Size (letter n)  
2. Units of Measurement  
"The time in **milliseconds**...
For the purposes of Big O, we won’t be considering this measurement... Regardless, this will always be a measurement of run-time.

The number of **operations** that are executed...

The number of **“Basic Operations”** that are executed.
“Basic Operation” refers to the operation that is contributing the most to the total running time."  
3. Orders of Growth  
"...Order of Growth represents the increase in **Running Time** or **Memory Space**."

"**Constant Complexity** means that no matter what inputs are thrown at our algorithm, it always uses the same amount of time or space. The number 1 is used to represent a constant value."  
"Logarithmic Complexity represents a function that sees a decrease in the rate of complexity growth, the greater our value of n."  
4. Best Case, Worst Case, and Average Case  

- "Big O(oh): This notation describes the Worst Case (The efficiency for the worst possible input of size n) for an algorithm. The Order of Growth used represents the upper bounds of Time and Space.
- Big Omega: This notation describes the Best Case (The efficiency for the best possible input of size n) for a given algorithm. The Order of Growth used represents the lower bounds of Time and Space.
- Big Theta: This notation describes the Average Case. (The efficiency for a “typical” or “random” input of size n.) The Order of Growth used represents the tight bound of Time and Space."
