What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and why do we care?  
"The idea of assigning system access to users based on their role in an organization."  

Describe a Role/Permission heirarchy that you might implement using RBAC.  
You might have a company where there are documents that aren't confidenitial but that need to be protected.  For that you could assign only top level employees or tech support access to create or delete a file, while other employees may only have access to read or add to a file, but not edit or delete anything.  

What approach might you take to implement RBAC?  
Not sure if answer above answers this.  

## [wiki-RBAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control)  

If Authentication is “you are who you say you are,” what is Authorization?  
This is what you can do.  

Name three primary rules defined for RBAC.  
"Role assignment: A subject can exercise a permission only if the subject has selected or been assigned a role.  
Role authorization: A subject's active role must be authorized for the subject. With rule 1 above, this rule ensures that users can take on only roles for which they are authorized.  (Like a title)
Permission authorization: A subject can exercise a permission only if the permission is authorized for the subject's active role. With rules 1 and 2, this rule ensures that users can exercise only permissions for which they are authorized."  (what someone with that title can do)  

Describe RBAC to a non-technical friend.  
It's like the computer version of military rankings or company badges with different authority with each badge.

What Are access rights Associated with? The User? or The Role? Explain.  
Roles.  Your access rights depend on what role you have.  

Access Rights, or Authorization, is activated after a user successfully does what?  
Is given a role/ has a role activated.  

Explain how RBAC might benefit a business.  
Policy doesn't need to be updated when a person leaves a company.  New employees shiuld be able to work with their access rights when given a role.  Roles can be switched to give new priveleges.  SELinux supports RBAC.
