How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?  
It's a program that takes code uses it to run things on our computer.  

What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?  
It means it's a program we use to execute JS on our computers.  

What is Node used for?  
To make JS run and give us tools to manipulate it.  With the node package manager we can set up new files locally, like autopopulated package.json files, or download new packages from the web.  Node can be used to bundle, test, check and correct code.  It also lets us run JS on servers.
