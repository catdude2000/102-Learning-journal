# Event Driven Architecture

 News forum that only allows evidence based content but doesn't discriminate based on opinion.  Everything gets published, in it's proper category, as long as it's not fake or an ad.  Live news gets a priority, opinion pieces are either banned or put to the back.  As simple as a community run page can be.

Live group deal finding app where people looking for the same good/service work together to find the best deal.  Goal is to find a deal everyone (all 3, 4 or 5 in a group) can benefit from.  Like groupon, but based on new current searches between companies that wouldn't usually allow themselves to be compared, or whatever the user chooses.  Provide list of biggest providers of good/service being searched for.
