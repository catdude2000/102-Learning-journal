# Express, NPM, TDD, CI/CD  

These tools make it much easier to create, deploy, update, and manage services without interrupting them.

### [An introduction to NodeJS and Express](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction)

Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.  
Middleware is what interprets the data you send and get from a server to your computer/browser.  

Express the most popular __ __ ____.  
Node web framework.  

Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?  
Has far less restrictions than opinionated frameworks on how to fit components together for a purpose, making it easier for developers to use the best tools suited for a task.  

What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?  
A module is a specific block of code that does one task.  This helps make code easier to read and fix, and helps avoid repitition.  

### [What is NPM?](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm)  

What version of npm are you running on your machine?  
9.6.4  

What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?  
npm i jshint  

### [CI/CD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2aNsQKwyOo)  

What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?  
Uninterrupted deployment/service, allows multiple people to work on an app at the same time, allows easy testing.  

What is the difference between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment?  
Continuous delivery makes code constantly ready to deploy, as opposed to just automatically deploying it.  

Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background  
Gihub tests new app versions automatically when you make them and automatically sends it to where the app is running, when appropriate.

## Reflection  

What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class [README](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-02/)?  
I'd like to learn more ways to write tests and uses for "next".  

## Things I'd like to know more about

When is it best to use continuous delivery vs deployment?  Real world examples?
