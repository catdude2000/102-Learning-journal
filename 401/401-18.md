# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

## Reading

### [AWS API Gateway Overview](https://www.serverless.com/amazon-api-gateway)

What is Amazon API Gateway?  
"Amazon API Gateway is a managed service that allows developers to define the HTTP endpoints of a REST API or a WebSocket API and connect those endpoints with the corresponding backend business logic. It also handles authentication, access control, monitoring, and tracing of API requests."  

Why is Amazon API Gateway an important part of the Serverless ecosystem?  
"...conveniently replaces the API servers with a managed serverless solution."  
"...brings the advantages of the serverless model—scalability, low maintenance, and low cost due to low overhead—to mainstream web applications."  

How does API Gateway integrate with other AWS services?  
"...integrations allow for fully managed authentication and authorization layers, as well as detailed metrics and tracing for API requests."  
Supports:  

- Invoking an AWS Lambda function.
- Invoking another HTTP endpoint, with or without VPC Link.
- Making an HTTP call against the API of any AWS service that provides an HTTP API.
- Returning a mock response generated within API Gateway without calling out to other services."  

### [AWS API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/)

What are the some benefits of using Amazon API Gateway?  
"...makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale."  
No minimum fees or startup costs.  

What two API types might you choose from?  
RESTful APIs and WEBSOCKET APIs  

### [AWS DynamoDB Guide](https://www.dynamodbguide.com/what-is-dynamo-db/)

What is DynamoDB?  
A hosted NoSQL db offered by AWS.  

Under what circumstances would you recommend DynamoDB over MongoDB?  
Large amounts of data and strict latency reqs, serverless apps using lambda, data sets with simple, known access patterns.  

### [AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)

Explain to a non-technical friend how DynamoDB works.
It holds app info securely.  

### [Dynamoose](https://dynamoosejs.com/getting_started/Introduction)

What is Dynamoose?  
A modeling tool for DynamoDB.  

What are some key features of Dynamoose?  

- Type safety
- High level API
- Easy to use syntax
- DynamoDB Single Table Design Support
- Ability to transform data before saving or retrieving items

## Reflection

What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class [README](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-18/)?  
To be able to look at all these different services and see the tools as they are, not just random names.
