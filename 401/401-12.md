## Reading

### [Web Sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)

What is a Web Socket?  
"...a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection."  

Describe the Web Socket request/response handshake and what happens once the connection is established.  

"...the WebSocket handshake uses the HTTP Upgrade header to change from the HTTP protocol to the WebSocket protocol."  
"...the client sends a WebSocket handshake request, for which the server returns a WebSocket handshake response..."  
"...allowing servers to handle HTTP connections as well as WebSocket connections on the same port. Once the connection is established, communication switches to a bidirectional binary protocol which does not conform to the HTTP protocol."  

Web Sockets provide a standardized way for the server to send content to a client without first receiving a ____ from that client.

What does the event handler io.on() do?  
handles connection, disconnection and other events using the socket object.  

Describe some possible proof of life or proof that the code works as expected  
Check browser, check server console logs, refresh browser to disconnect socket connection and reconnect, check for logs.  

What does socket.emit() do?  
Create and fire custom events.  

[Socket.io vs Web Sockets](https://www.educba.com/websocket-vs-socket-io/)

What is the difference between WebSocket and Socket.IO? (think Git and GitHub, or OAuth and Auth0).  
Web socket makes real time communication easy and efficient, provides full-duplex communication.  
Socket.IO helps in broadcasting multiple sockets at a time, works on all platforms, transperant communication, uses server-side and client-side libraries.

## Videos

[OSI Model Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv4y_uOneC0)

What are a couple of key takeaways from this video?  
OSI model allows communication between computers with different OSs.  

[TCP Handshakes Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtP5ZB3wSk)

Translate the gist of this video to a non-technical friend  
When you want to connect to an online database or service, you basically send a request to connect, and then and ok from both sides.

## Reflection

What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class [README](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-12/)?
I hope to be able to identify what large companies/services use as far as these types of connection tools.
