# Event Driven Applications

## Reading

### [Event Driven Programming](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nodejs-event-driven-programming)

What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?  
EventEmitter.  

What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?  
"By registering event listeners we can actually reverse the flow of communication between our objects. Rather than on object needing to reach inside another object to trigger a function, our objects can just emit events and whichever objects are listening to those event will process it in the way they have been told to. The source of an objects behavior is now entirely contained within itself, rather than needing to be accessed by external objects."  

Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.  
EDP allows interactions from the user to make things happen in the code, allowing for customized experiences and more interactivity, as well as more code functionality, allowing the code to do more things.
