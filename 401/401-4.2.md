What type of database is the best fit for the complex query intensive environment?  
SQL  

What type of database is the best fit for hierarchical data storage?  
NoSQL

Describe the differences in scalability between a SQl and NoSQL database as though you were speaking to a non-technical friend.  
SQL requires more computer power and builds vertically, NoSQL can just be extended, like a long line.  

### [sql modeling techniques](https://www.essentialsql.com/get-ready-to-learn-sql-7-simplified-data-modeling/)

Among data tables, what is a one-to-many relationship and how do we “relate” them?  
When an entry in one table can be related to more than one entry in another, visually depicted in lines, matched with compound keys.  

Prior to designing your relational database, it might be useful to ___a___ of the database tables and their relationships.  
Make a diagram.  

Explain the difference between a primary and foreign key.  
Primary keys uniquely identify each (a single) row in a table, foreign key is a column or set of columns that match a primary key in another table.

How do we treat keywords and parameters differently in SQL syntax?  
Keywords are uppercase and parameters are lowercase and in single or double quotes.  (usually)  

Define normalization within the context of schemas and data.  
It's breaking down data/schemas and organizing them.  

Explain the difference between one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships to a non-technical recruiter.  
They are pretty literally described.  A one-to-one is when one piece of a table is related to one and only one other piece, and vice versa. One-to-many is when one has a relationship to many, many-to-many is many pieces related to many other.

## Reflection

What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class [README](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-04/)?  

I'm excited to be able to describe some uses and methods for uses in SQL.

## Things I'd like to know more about

Am I right in saying compound keys relating table columns is how to "relate" in a one-to-many relationship?
