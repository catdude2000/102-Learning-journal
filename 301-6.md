1. What is node.js?  
Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.  

2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?  
It's an open-source Javascript engine in chrome that was designed for performance and compiles JS directly to native machine code  

3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?  
It is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers.  

4. What is npm?  
a package manager that comes bundled with Node.  

5. What version of node are you running on your machine?  
v14.17.3  

6. What version of npm are you running on your machine?  
7.21.1  

7. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?

8. What is node used for?  
designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.  
 bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.  
frameworks (and many, many related packages) are all available via npm and rely on Node to create a sensible development environment in which they can run.  Lets Us Run JavaScript on the Server.  

6 Reasons for Pair Programming  

1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?  
Greater efficiency, Engaged collaboration, Learning from fellow students, Social skills, Job interview readiness, Work environment readiness.  

2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?  
Work environment readiness and learning form fellow students.  

3. How does pair programming work?  
involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
