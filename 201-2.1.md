Class One
Intro
Web browsers allow you to communicate with web servers.
Screen readers help visually impaired.
HTML 5 and CSS3 are newest versions.

Ch 1:Structure
HTML elements are usually made up of two tags, opening and closing.
< head> element contains information about the page
< title> is shown in tab
Content Management System allows for adding information into what's usually a single template.

Ch 8: Doctypes
Doctype declaration is used at start of code to specify which version of html the page is using.
ID attribute is known as a "global attribute" because it can be used on any element
Class attributes can be used to identify multiple elements for manipulation
multpil classes in a single element are separated by a single space
Elements that always start on a new line are "block level" elements.
Elements apperaing on the same line as other elemntas are called "inline"
< span> is inline version of < div>, most commonly used for CSS manipulation
< iframe> is inline frame, uses src, height, width, scrolling (determines whether or not scroll bars are used, not in html5), frameborder (1=border 0=no border, not in html5), and seamless (new in html5, can be applied to iframe where scrollbars are not desired)
< meta> elemant lives inside < head> element, no closing tag, can be used to tell search engines about page.
"robots" in meta tag indicates whether to add to search results, "noindex" means should not be added, "nofollow" means pages linked to page should not be in search results.
"pragma" prevents the browser from catching the page (storing locally to save load time)
"expires" indicates when page should expire and no longer be cached.
escape characters, like &lt;, allow for characters such as < to be used on a page.

Ch 17: HTML5 Layout
New HTML elemnts indicate the purpose of different parts of the page and help describe it's structure, providing clearer code.
older browsers need to be told which elemnts are block-level.
Extrs JS is needed for IE 8  and older.
< article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.
< section> groups related content together, typically with it's own heading.
< figure> and < figcaption> are for images.

Ch 18: Process and Design
"Card sorting" is a technique used to help decide what info should go on each page
Wireframes are basic drawings organizing what goes on each page
"Visual hierarchy" helps viitors understand what you are trying to tell them.


JS
Ch 1: ABC of Programming
Web browsers are programs built using objects.
Current web page loaded into each window is modelled using a "document object"
src is not needed when js is in html
document.write('Good Afternoon!'); is an example of calling a method (write is method)
,script element is used in html pages to tell tha browser to load the js file
