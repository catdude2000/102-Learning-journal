# Reading Notes 6

JS Primitive Values vs Object References article
JS currently supports 8 data types
-Boolean
-Null
-Undefined
-Number
-BigInt
-String
-Symbol
-Objects
all are primitive data types except objects
arrays, functions and dates are objects under the hood
When a variable is assigned to an object, it's a "reference" to the object unlike a primitive value with a variable
Primitive values are immutable (cant be changed), object references are mutable
to create a new object instead of a new reference use Object.assign
this allows for copying one object to another without changing the original object
== returns true if values are the same
=== returns true if values and data types are the same


JS book
Ch 3(continued): Object Literals
in an object variables become known as properties/functions become methods
names of properties and objects are called "keys"
"literal Notation" is the easiest and most popular way to create objects
access the properties or methods of an object using dot notation
 -can also access properties using square brackets
. is known as the "member operator"

Ch 5: Document Object Model
DOM specifies how browsers should create a model of an html page and how JS can access and update the contents while in the browser
as a browser loads a page it creates a DOM tree
DOM tree consists of document node, element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes
many ways to access an element (getelementbyid/classname/tagname, queryselector, traverse using relationships {parentNode, previous/nextsibling, first/lastchild})
"nodeValue" lets you access or update contents of a text node
"innerHTML" allows access to child elements and text content
"textContent" for just text content
"createElement()", "CreatTextNode()", "append/removeChild()" let you add and remove nodes
has/get/set/removeAttribute() checks/gets/updates/removes values
"className/id" lets you get and update the value of class and id attributes
nodeLists have a  method called "item()" which will return an individual node from a node list
"Array syntax" is preferred over the item() mtheod because it's faster
adding html using innerHTML can make you vulnerable to "Cross-Site Scripting Attacks" (XSS)
data you don't have complete control over is called "untrusted data"
