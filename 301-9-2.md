# Reading Notes 9  

Functional Programming Concepts  

1. What is functional programming?  
Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data  

2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?  
It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)  
It does not cause any observable side effects

3. What are the benefits of a pure function?  
Easy to know the outcome, doesn't mess up other functions, easy to test  

4. What is immutability?  
Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.  

5. What is Referential transparency?  
pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency

2. What does the word ‘require’ do?
