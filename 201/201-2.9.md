There are several CSS properties specifically used to control the apperance of lists, tables and forms.  
list markers can be given different apperances using the list-style-type and list-style image properties  
Table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers, but there are properties you can us to make them more consistent  
Forms are easier to use if form controls are vertically aligned using CSS  
forms benefit from styles that make them feel more interactive
