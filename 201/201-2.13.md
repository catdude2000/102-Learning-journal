  They slow down app by transmitting same data over and over in each http request
  they can send data unencrypted over the net (unless entire app is served over  SSL)
  theyre limited to 4kb of data

-userData allows pages to store up to 64 KB of data per domain, in a hierarchical XML-based structure

-Gears by Google is an open source browser plugin aimed at providing additional capabilities in browsers

-“HTML5 Storage” is a specification named Web Storage (or DOM or Local storage)  

-to keep track programmatically of when the storage area changes, you can trap the storage event

-“5 megabytes” is how much storage space each origin gets by default (stores strings not data)

-“QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR” is the exception that will get thrown if you exceed 5 mb

-with html5 storage you can store data locally inside the browser for future use

- If you are storing something other than a string, you’ll need to coerce it yourself when you retrieve it
