HTML  
Ch 6: Tables  
A table represents info in a grid format  
each block in grid is known as a "table cell"  
< table> creates table  
< tr> starts a new row  
< td> wraps around each cell  
< th> is for a header row, better for creen readers, search engines, and helps with css  
"colspan" can be used to indicate how many columns a cell should run across  
  "rowspan"  indicates how far down to stetch an element  
< thead>, < tbody>, < tfoot>, help distinguish between main content of the table and the first and last rows.  
some older code implementations contain things like width/background that we should no longer use  

JS&Q  
Ch 3 cont.: Functions, Methods & Objects  
The new keyword and object constructor create a blank object, which you can add properties and methods to.  
add to and update objects using dot notation, can also update with []  
object constructors can use a function as a template for creating objects.  
new keyword followed by call to function creates a new object  
  example:var quayHotel = new Hotel ('Quay', 40, 25);  
browsers come with a set of built-in objects, like the browser window and the displayed page  
"object model" is a group of objects, each of which represent related things from the real world  
browser OM contains objects that represent the current browser window or tab.  
Document OM uses objects to create a representation of the current page, creates new object for each element  
Global JS Objects represent things that the JS language needs to create a model of.  
arrays and objects can contain each other  
JS built-in objects include string, number, math, and date
