# Notes 7

A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:  

- The name of the function.  
- A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.  
- The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.  

A function can refer to and call itself. There are three ways for a function to refer to itself:  

- The function's name  
- The functions arguments.  
- An in-scope variable that refers to the function  

## Control Flow  

Control flow is order in which computer executes statements in a script
A typical script in JavaScript or PHP (and the like) includes many control structures, including conditionals, loops and functions.  
Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from
start to finish, but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.  

The () Operator Invokes the Function  

## Local Variables  

Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.  
Variables with same name can be used in different functions.  
They're created when function starts and deleted once func has completed.
