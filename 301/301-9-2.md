# Reading Notes 9  

## Functional Programming Concepts  

What is functional programming?  
A style of building the structure and elements of computer programs using mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.  

What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?  
It's a function that is determenistic (same results every time theres the same arguments) and does not cause any observable side effects. If it reads external files, it's not a pure function.  Doesn't use random number generators

What are the benefits of a pure function?  
Code is easier to test.  

What is immutability?  
Unchanging over time or unable to be changed. Immutable data's state canot change after it's created.  

What is Referential transparency?  
If a function consistently yields the same resultfor the same input, it is referentially transparent.
