# Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack  

1. What is a ‘call’?  
A function invocation  

2. How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?  
1

3. What does LIFO mean?  
Last In, First Out  

4. Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.  
function firstFunction(){  
  console.log("Hello from firstFunction");  
}
function secondFunction(){  
  firstFunction();  
  console.log("The end from secondFunction");  
}  
secondFunction();  

5. What causes a Stack Overflow?  
When there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) with no exit point.  

JavaScript error messages  

1. What is a ‘reference error’?  
An error that occurs when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared.  

2. What is a ‘syntax error’?  
This occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax, like when you try to parse an invalid object using JSON.parse.  

3. What is a ‘range error’?  
Try to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length and this kind of error will show up.

4. What is a ‘type error’?  
show up when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible (like undefined)

5. What is a breakpoint?  
JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values.

6. What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?
adds a breakpoint
