Reading  
## Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack  
<https://medium.freecodecamp.org/understanding-the-javascript-call-stack-861e41ae61d4>

What is a ‘call’?  
A function invocation.  

How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?  
One.  

What does LIFO mean?  
Last in, first out.  (a principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation)  

Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.  


////////////////////////////////////  

### From Reading*

function firstFunction(){  
  throw new Error('Stack Trace Error');  
}  

function secondFunction(){  
  firstFunction();  
}  

function thirdFunction(){  
  secondFunction();  
}  

thirdFunction();

What causes a Stack Overflow?  
A recursive function. (calls itself) with no exit point.  Browsers have a maximum stack call that it an handle before throwing a stack error.

## Things I want to know more about

Debugger statements, stack overflow related to system computing power?
